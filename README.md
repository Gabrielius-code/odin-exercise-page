Welcome!
This is the first time I made a page from scratch using HTML and CSS.
I actually had 0 issues doing this page, if I faced some issues or didn't know how to do something I just used Google and I found out a solution.
In CSS basically I used flexbox, because I only learnt that so far in my web development journey.
After I will learn more things (JavaScript) I will probably remake this page, if not, then it will be my first page from scratch.
I was using The Odin Project design. Desing was shown in picture, I also was given fonts and colors for the text too.
